### Basic Ideas of Neural Networks
Single layer perceptron can only solve linearly separable problems. In order to solve nonlinear problems, multilayer perceptron is used. Neural networks are used in supervised and unsupervised learning. 

Reduced Coulomb Energy network is a self growing network for supervised learning, each input node is a feature in the given pattern.

Radial Basis Function network is another supervised learning architecture. Each hidden node is a RBF function which gives the same activation value for inputs within the same radial distance of the node centre. To select these centers, choose them randomly, use clustering or supervised selection.
